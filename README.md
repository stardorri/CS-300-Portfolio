# CS 300 Portfolio – Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains portfolio artifacts from CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms. The work demonstrates my ability to analyze data structures and implement an efficient solution using C++.

## What problem was I solving?
The goal was to design a system that could load, search, and display Computer Science course data efficiently, including prerequisites, while supporting sorted output for academic planning.

## How did I approach the problem?
I compared vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to understand their runtime and memory tradeoffs. Understanding data structures was essential to choosing the most efficient solution based on the program’s requirements.

## How did I overcome roadblocks?
Challenges included parsing file input correctly and implementing recursive tree operations. These were solved through careful input validation, consistent formatting, and methodical testing.

## How has this project expanded my approach to software design?
This project reinforced the importance of selecting appropriate data structures before implementation and designing solutions based on performance and scalability.

## How has this project improved my coding practices?
I focused on writing readable, modular, and maintainable code using clear structure and naming conventions, making the program adaptable for future changes.

## Included Artifacts
- Project One: Runtime and memory analysis of data structures
- Project Two: C++ program implementing a Binary Search Tree for course management
